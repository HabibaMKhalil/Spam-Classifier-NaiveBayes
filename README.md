#  SMS Spam Classifier with Naive Bayes  
*A real-time spam detection system deployed with Streamlit*  

![Demo](spam.jpg)  
*Classify messages instantly with visual feedback*  

##  Overview  
This project implements a **Naive Bayes classifier** to detect spam SMS messages. Built with Python and Streamlit, it demonstrates how machine learning can automate text filtering for communication platforms.  

**Key Features:**  
- Real-time spam/ham classification  
- Interactive Streamlit web interface  
- Visual feedback (red for spam, green for legitimate)  
- Model accuracy metrics included  

##  Dataset  
Trained on the `sms_spam.csv` dataset containing labeled SMS messages:  
- **spam**: Unwanted promotional/malicious messages  
- **ham**: Legitimate personal messages  

##  Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **Streamlit** (Web Interface)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Naive Bayes Model)  
- **Pandas** (Data Processing)  

##  Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Spam-SMS-Classifier.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Usage
Run the app locally:

bash
